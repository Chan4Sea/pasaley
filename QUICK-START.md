# Quick Start: Testing the Map UI Fix

## What's Fixed
The map control bar has been converted to a floating overlay that no longer blocks map interactions.

## Fastest Way to Test

### 1. Start the Production Server
```bash
cd /workspace/pasaley-app
pnpm install  # If dependencies not installed
pnpm build    # Build production version
pnpm start    # Start server on port 3000
```

### 2. Open in Browser
```
http://localhost:3000/map
```

### 3. Verify the Fix
- Click and drag the map anywhere (especially in the top center area)
- Map should respond smoothly without any blocked areas
- Control bar should be centered and not block interactions
- All controls should still work (radius selector, etc.)

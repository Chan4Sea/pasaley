# Quick Testing Guide for Map UI Fix

## What Was Fixed
The map screen control bar has been converted from a blocking overlay to a floating, centered control panel that doesn't interfere with map interactions.

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Local Production Build (Fastest for Testing)

```bash
cd /workspace/pasaley-app

# Install dependencies (if not already)
pnpm install

# Build production version
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start

# Open in browser
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/map
```

### Option 2: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended for Sharing)

```bash
cd /workspace/pasaley-app

# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts and get your deployment URL
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Other Platform

See DEPLOYMENT.md for Railway, Render, or Netlify instructions.

## Visual Test Checklist

Once the app is running, test the following on the Map page (`/map`):

### 1. Map Interactions (PRIMARY FIX)
- [ ] Click and drag the map - should work smoothly
- [ ] Zoom in/out using mouse wheel or pinch - should work
- [ ] Click on store markers - should open info windows
- [ ] Click on map (not on markers) - should NOT be blocked by control bar

### 2. Control Bar Functionality
- [ ] Control bar should be centered at the top
- [ ] Should be narrower than before (max 900px or 92% viewport width)
- [ ] Store count badge should appear in the header (blue pill)
- [ ] Radius selector should work:
  - [ ] Change to 2 km - store count updates
  - [ ] Change to 5 km - store count updates
  - [ ] Change to 10 km - store count updates
  - [ ] Change to 20 km - store count updates (new option)

### 3. Responsive Design
Test at different screen sizes:

**Mobile (< 640px):**
- [ ] Control bar fits within viewport
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] All controls accessible
- [ ] Map remains interactive

**Tablet (768px - 1024px):**
- [ ] Control bar properly centered
- [ ] Appropriate width for screen size
- [ ] Map fully interactive

**Desktop (> 1024px):**
- [ ] Control bar max width (900px)
- [ ] Centered with space on sides
- [ ] Professional appearance

### 4. Edge Cases
- [ ] Error messages display correctly (if any)
- [ ] Loading state doesn't interfere with controls
- [ ] Geolocation prompt works
- [ ] Info windows don't get blocked by control bar

## Key Visual Indicators

### Before (Issues):
- Control bar stretched nearly full width
- Multiple separate cards stacked vertically
- Blocked map clicks underneath
- Hard to interact with map markers near top

### After (Fixed):
- Single compact card centered at top
- Maximum 900px width, responsive on smaller screens
- Map fully clickable everywhere
- Clean, professional floating design
- Store count now shows as badge in header

## Expected Behavior

1. **Map Click**: Should register click events on the map behind the control area
2. **Marker Click**: Should still work normally
3. **Drag**: Should be able to drag the map even in the top center area
4. **Zoom**: Should work everywhere on the map
5. **Control Bar**: Should only respond to direct clicks on buttons/selects

## Browser DevTools Check

Open DevTools (F12) and:
1. Check Console - no errors related to map or controls
2. Inspect the control bar element:
   - Parent div should have `pointer-events-none`
   - Inner card should have `pointer-events-auto`
   - Should see `w-[min(900px,92vw)]` class
3. Try clicking through the transparent overlay areas

## Success Criteria

All of the following should be true:
- ✓ Map is fully interactive (can click anywhere)
- ✓ Control bar doesn't block map interactions
- ✓ All controls (radius selector, etc.) still work
- ✓ Responsive on all screen sizes
- ✓ No layout issues or overlaps
- ✓ Professional, clean appearance

## If You Find Issues

Check:
1. Browser cache cleared?
2. Using production build (not dev mode)?
3. Browser Developer Tools console for errors?
4. Correct screen size/zoom level?

## Files Changed

Only one file modified:
- `app/map/page.tsx` (lines 180-218)

All other functionality remains unchanged.
